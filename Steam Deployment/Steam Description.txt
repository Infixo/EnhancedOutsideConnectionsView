[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
This mod introduces a show/hide check box for each import and export resource on the Outside Connections info view.  Your check box selections are remembered between games.  The numerical amount of each resource is also displayed.

When a resource is checked, the resource is included in the pie chart and total.  The buildings and vehicles importing/exporting that resource from/to outside conections are shown normally.

When a resource is unchecked, the resource is excluded from the pie chart and total.  The buildings and vehicles importing/exporting that resource from/to outside connections are shown in neutral color.

This mod is especially useful for hiding Mail on the Outside Connections info view.  The amount of Mail being imported or exported can be much greater than the amount of other resources.  The relatively large amount of Mail makes it difficult to see the amount of other resources.  This mod supersedes my now deprecated [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2093019121]Exclude Mail[/url] mod.

Note that the game logic may mark some buildings and vehicles as both importing and exporting at the same time.
